# Consultation

My consultation work is essentially one of three things;
- Looking at scripts or a collection of scripts provided by you to which I criticize and suggest where you can improve / structure the code better.

- Viewing your codebase and suggesting improvements to the code itself and the organization and structure of your codebase itself.

- Ideas on implementing different systems, simple and advanced, and methods you could try.

- Improving your scripting skills and the performance of your code by providing references, concepts and/or topics to look into.

- Insight into methods of planning and developing systems from the ground up, namely creating 'data flow' in your code and practicing to identify it and use it.

### Terms and Conditions

- **I will not script anything in your game after giving consultation. Consultation is to provide ideas and not actually implementing them.**
- **You will not receive your consultation until after the upfront payment is completed.**
- The consultation will occur on **discord**. This mainly will be in direct messages or any dedicated server / group chat for group consultations.
- I can provide a sample consultation for **one** of your **smaller** consulted pieces.
- I will not consult scripts longer than 1000 lines or ridiculously messy / troll code.
- If I cannot provide feedback at the time, or am interrupted mid-feedback and am unable to continue, I will provide feedback at a different time.
- Payment is done through Paypal and is sent under 'Friends and Family'. If you send it under business, the consultation will have to wait until payment goes through **completely**.
- I can provide a recorded consultation video for codebase inspections, however, implementation consultations and learning guidances will be in textchats or in a voicecall form.
- If the consultation is for more than one person, such as a group of scripters, please let me know beforehand (does not affect pricing).

I will drop your consultation if I believe its pointless to continue, namely under one of these conditions:
- Complete beginner trying to implement advanced systems.
- Simple question and no point in consultation cost.
- Super messy/unreadable code.
- etc.

If I'm unable to provide insight to an area you've asked about, I will tell you that I am unable to provide insight to that area and move on.

### Process of Consultation

1. You add me on discord @spook_exe, you may need to wait for me to accept the friend request unless you are in some popular Roblox discord developer servers.
2. Say that you are after my consultation service for 'X type' or 'X,Y,Z types'.
3. Wait for my response, generally I'll ask for more information on the what you're after and break it into pieces that are more easily priceable, as well as your timezone.
4. After that, confirm you have read the Terms and Conditions.

5. Per-aspect processes:

	**Codebase Inspection:**
	5.1.1. You send the related code for codebase inspection (Roblox place file).
	5.1.2. I prepare the consultation material on my end, reviewing your codebase and finding improvements / issues. If there is none I can really provide, ill let you know and no fee will be charged.

	**Implementation Consultation:**
	5.2.1. You give the general idea for the implementation
	5.2.2. I check whether I can provide insight to it or not
	5.2.3. If i can provide insight, I prepare the materials on my end after brainstorming and gathering references.

	**Learning Guidance:**
	5.3.1. You give a general idea of your coding level. You send me code samples and/or provide a general idea of what you have scripted, I might view some of those related code as well.
	5.3.2. I brainstorm during the conversation on areas you can look into, videos you should watch, topics you should learn, etc.
	5.3.3. I'll double check if the feedback I provide is helpful to you and tweak it accordingly.

6. I'll confirm the upfront payment for you to receive the feedback.
7. You receive the consultation feedback in text, call or video form.
8. Other half of the consultation price is paid after feedback is given.

### Pricing and Payment

To summarize these three aspects of consulations:
- **Codebase Inspection**: View your codebase, find bad code then report it with optional ideas for improving it.

- **Implementation Consulation**: Recieve feedback, insight and ideas on implementing a target mechanic/system into your code; if I cannot provide insight to a mechanic/system, I will let you know.

- **Learning Guidance**: Receive guidance and ideas on what you could code to improve your coding skills and knowledge. Also receive insight and methods to implement systems from the ground up, namely long-term practical skills.
